# Story Telling with Data using Tableau

**Project Date:** September 2024

## Description

This project focuses on helping a client identify the root causes behind returned orders by using data visualization and storytelling with Tableau. The goal was to provide actionable insights through well-designed dashboards and clear, easy-to-interpret visualizations that highlight trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to order returns.

## Key Features

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Utilized Tableau to analyze return rates and identify potential causes for order returns.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Created a user-friendly and structured dashboard that provides real-time insights into return patterns and causes.
- **Storytelling with Data:** Developed a comprehensive Tableau story that guides the client through the analysis, dashboard interpretation, and actionable steps to address the identified issues.
- **Filters for Detailed Insights:** Incorporated interactive filters to allow the user to drill down into specific segments of data to uncover deeper insights.

## Installation Instructions
   
1. Open the Tableau workbook (.twb) file using Tableau Desktop.

2. If you don't have Tableau, you can download a free trial from [[Tableauâ€™s website](https://www.tableau.com/products/trial)](https://public.tableau.com/views/Sprint4Project_17319757631570/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

3. Connect to your data source (the project assumes you have data on orders and returns).

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. Open the Tableau workbook and navigate to the dashboard.
2. Use the filters on the dashboard to view specific data segments (e.g., by product type, region, etc.).
3. Interpret the visualizations to identify potential root causes for returned orders.
4. Follow the narrative in the Tableau Story for guidance on how to analyze and take actions based on findings.
