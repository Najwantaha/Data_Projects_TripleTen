# Data Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed ride data for a new ride-sharing company, Zuber, launching in Chicago. The analysis focused on understanding passenger preferences and testing hypotheses about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

## SQL Queries
The following queries were written to analyze the data:
- `hypothesis_test.sql`: SQL code to test the hypothesis about ride frequency on rainy Saturdays.
- `passenger_preference_analysis.sql`: Analysis of passenger preferences based on weather and time.

## Report
