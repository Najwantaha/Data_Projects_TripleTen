Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.

# Storytelling with Data using Tableau

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify the root causes for returned orders through data visualizations in Tableau. The dashboard allows users to monitor return rates and filter data to pinpoint issues.

## Features
- Multiple visualizations analyzing return rates.
- Interactive dashboard for root cause analysis.
- Filters to drill down by product categories, time periods, and more.

## How to Use
1. Open the `returns_analysis.twbx` file in Tableau.
2. Use the filters on the dashboard to analyze returns by different dimensions.
3. Follow the story to understand the findings.

# Data Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed ride data for a new ride-sharing company, Zuber, launching in Chicago. The analysis focused on understanding passenger preferences and testing hypotheses about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

## SQL Queries
The following queries were written to analyze the data:
- `hypothesis_test.sql`: SQL code to test the hypothesis about ride frequency on rainy Saturdays.
- `passenger_preference_analysis.sql`: Analysis of passenger preferences based on weather and time.

## Report
You can view the full report on the [impact of weather on rides](reports/impact_of_weather_on_rides.pdf).
